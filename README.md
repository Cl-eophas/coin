The Python script generate_qr.py provides functionality for managing a user database and generating QR codes for each user. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:
1. Imports and Dependencies:
The script imports the qrcode module for generating QR codes.
The sqlite3 module is used for database operations.
The PIL (Pillow) library is used for image handling.
2. Database Setup:
create_database(): This function sets up a SQLite database named user_database.db. It creates a table named users if it doesn't already exist, with columns for id, name, email, and phone. The id is the primary key.
3. Adding Users:
add_user(name, email, phone): This function adds a new user to the users table. It checks for the uniqueness of the email field to avoid duplicates. If the insertion is successful, it returns the user_id of the newly added user; otherwise, it returns None.
4. Viewing Users:
view_users(): This function fetches and displays all users from the users table. It prints the id, name, email, and phone of each user.
5. Generating QR Codes:
generate_qr_from_database(user_id): This function generates a QR code for a specific user based on their user_id. It retrieves the user's data from the database, and if the user exists, it creates a QR code containing the user's data as a string. The QR code is saved as an image file named user_{user_id}_qr.png.
6. Main Execution Flow:
The script starts by creating the database.
It then enters a loop where it prompts the user to choose an action: add a user, view users, or exit.
Depending on the user's choice, it either adds a new user and generates a QR code for them, displays all users, or exits the loop and ends the program.
This script effectively combines database operations with QR code generation, providing a simple command-line interface for managing users and their associated QR codes.
